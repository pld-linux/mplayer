 when compiled with -mabi=altivec gcc saves and restores altivec registers
 in long jump macro, it's bad, mplayer don't use long jump much, but uses it
 for returning from sigill catch routine, so the problem was ILL was sent
 before sigill catch was completely prepared
 I hope -mabi=altivec is not really needed
